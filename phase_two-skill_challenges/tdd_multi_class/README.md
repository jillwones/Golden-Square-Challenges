# Test-drive a Multi-Class Program

In these challenges we started off test-driving a single method. Then we moved to test-driving a class, which incorporated multiple methods. Now we will move again to test-driving a system involving multiple classes.       

Tests for multiple classes acting together are called ***integration*** tests or sometimes ***feature*** tests. Tests for a single class or method are called ***unit*** tests.
