# Challenge
There is a codebase in [`codebases/mocking_bites`](../codebases/mocking_bites).

Clone this repository and open the `codebases/mocking_bites` directory in your
editor.

There are some classes and tests in there representing a `TaskList` program.
There are some unit tests for `TaskList` in `spec/task_list_spec.rb`. They
currently avoid testing any behaviour that might use the `Task` class.

Use mocking techniques to add some tests that fully test the behaviour of
`TaskList`.
