# Debugging 2

In the first debugging session we spoke about the difference between Change Debugging and Discovery Debugging.     

We saw the benefits of using Discovery Debugging and getting visibility by using ```p``` to print out the values of a program and see how they change during the execution of a program.        

In this session we look at another technique for Discovery Debugging - binding.irb. It is a lightweight interactive debugger.
