# Solo Project Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem
 
> As a customer  
> So that I can check if I want to order something  
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.
> 
> As a customer  
> So that I can order the meal I want  
> I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.
> 
> As a customer  
> So that I can verify that my order is correct  
> I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

Use the `twilio-ruby` gem to implement this next one. You will need to use
doubles too.

> As a customer  
> So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time  
> I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and
> will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.


## 2. Design the Class System

```ruby


```
 
## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
 
```ruby

```
 
## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
 
```ruby


```
 
## 5. Implement the Behaviour
 
For each example you create as a test, implement the behaviour that allows the
class to behave according to your example.
 
Then return to step 3 until you have addressed the problem you were given. You
may also need to revise your design, for example if you realise you made a
mistake earlier.
